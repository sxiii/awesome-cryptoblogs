## Cryptoblogs
In short, cryptoblogs are websites where you could start your own blog, while learning crypto for your posts or other activities. Main aspects or features of cryptoblogs are usually decentralization, open-sourceness, delegation system, community involvement and others.

If you know some cryptoblog that isn't listed here, feel free to create a pull request or write an issue so I add it.

## Crypto socializing, mediablockchains
I've tried to separate the list by blockchain that stands in the base of the project. One of the first and the most successful basis for cryptoblogs was Steemit. It was not the first cryptoblog ever, but just counting exact number of forks that worked on Steemit basis is actually a hard task. 

## Updated
This repo was last updated 26 january 2020. 

## What information do I include
1) I was thinking on whereever I should include some dynamic information like platform ranking. But this type of info got outdated fast, so I decided not to add it. 
2) The only thing that isn't frequently changing is crypto that's working for inside blockchain transactions, so I decided to include that. However, bear in mind, that some of Cryptoblogs are also building their token ecosystem (they usually call their tokens "User Issued Assets" or UIA), and I am not including UIA's in this list.
3) I also included crypto-videoblogs for several reasons. Some of them are: cryptovideoblogs are frequently based on cryptoblogs basis, as well as topic is very close.
4) If somebody knows musical, books, films sharing crypto networks, please let me know (except for Torrents, obviously), and I will include them as well.
5) I am not adding crypto-games in here, as this will be a pretty long list, especially with ETH and Steemit games that was there or that are still there.
6) This list includes platforms that are still alive as-of date of this post. Platforms that are defunct or closed are listed in the end of this list for histrotical purposes as well.
